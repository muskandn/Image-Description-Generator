Image Description Generator
for Assisting Visually
Impaired Individual

## INTRODUCTION
The "Image Description Generator for Assisting
Visually Impaired Individuals" aims to leverage
AI-driven computer vision and NLP to generate
accurate, context-aware image descriptions.
Using an encoder-decoder neural network with
attention mechanisms, the system enhances
accessibility by providing real-time image-to-
audio conversion via a mobile app. With over
2.2 billion visually impaired people globally
(WHO), this project addresses a critical need for
inclusivity while optimizing model efficiency and
usability.
