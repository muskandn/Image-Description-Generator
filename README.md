## INTRODUCTION
The "Image Description Generator for Assisting
Visually Impaired Individuals" aims to leverage
AI-driven computer vision and NLP to generate
accurate, context-aware image descriptions.
Using an encoder-decoder neural network with
attention mechanisms, the system enhances
accessibility by providing real-time image-to-
audio conversion via a mobile app. With over
2.2 billion visually impaired people globally
(WHO), this project addresses a critical need for
inclusivity while optimizing model efficiency and
usability.

## PROBLEM STATEMENT
To study and develop a solution for predicting the description of the
images in real-time with good accuracy.
To further modify the existing models on image description
generation with new modifications to reduce the complexity and
training time of the proposed model.
To develop a native application for fetching the image description
given the image.
